A new perspective on transferring pan-cancer immunotherapy responses to guide breast cancer prognosis was introduced, providing deeper insights into tumor homogeneity. The protein-protein interaction network was utilized to bridge the genes and clinical phenotypes. A network-based method was proposed to support the identification of gene signatures for breast cancer prognosis based on immunotherapy responses.
